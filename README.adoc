# cobra-cli-template

This template provides a starting point for creating a CLI application using the Cobra library in Go.
It makes it easy to create a CLI application with subcommands, flags, and arguments.
It's a TDD centered approach to building CLI applications. It encourages the use of tests to ensure the correctness of the application's behavior.

## Usage

This is a TDD template which means you test commands by running a test suite.

To test commands, you can run the following command:

```sh
ginkgo run
```

To watch files for changes and re-run tests:

```sh
ginkgo watch
```

### Writing Commands

When you create a new command, you should follow these steps:

. Create a new file in the `cmd` directory with the name of the command.
. In the file, make a called New{CommandName}Cmd function that returns the command you see after using `cobra-cli add`.
. In the init()'s rootCmd.AddCommand() Use the function you created in step 2.
. In the function write the flags and arguments for the command after the variable creation.
. Write tests for the command in the `cmd` directory.

TIP: Use the `cobra-cli add` command to create a new command.

NOTE: Remember to always add arguments to your commands.

CAUTION: Gingko will run tests in parallel by default.
